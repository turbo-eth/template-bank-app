### Configuration
Since Bank is a TurboRepo application we have to manually set the deployment configuration.

#### Build & Development Settings
- Build Command - `pnpm build`
- Output Directory - `.next`
- Install Command - `pnpm install`

#### Root Directory
- `packages/web-app`
- ‚òëÔ∏è Include source files outside of the Root Directory in the Build Step

#### Environment Variables
The application requires a JSON-RPC provider. The `public` provider can be used for testing, but in production it's recommended to use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)

```
# Public Provider(s) - Useful for testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_PUBLIC=true

# Alchemy: https://www.alchemy.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=

# Infura: https://www.infura.io
